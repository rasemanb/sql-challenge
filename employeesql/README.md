# sql-challenge

In this challenge we were asked to create 6 different tables based off of the
data given and import each csv into the corresponding table. There were three
parts to this challenge which consisted of data modeling, data engineering, and
data analysis.

For the data modeling portion, we were asked to inspect each data file and
generate an ERD of the tables. This part was crucial to the assignment since
this allowed me to visualize the primary keys and foreign keys I needed to 
define in the schema when creating the tables. 

The data engineering portion required us to create a schema in pgAdmin for each
of the 6 data files given to us. For me, the most difficult part of the schema
is usually identifying the PK's and FK's, but thanks to the ERD it wasn't as 
difficult this time.

The data analysis portion asked 8 different questions, each requiring us to use 
multiple tables and join them or group by and return a new set of data.
